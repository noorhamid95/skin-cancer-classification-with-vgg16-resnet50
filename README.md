### Skin cancer

Skin cancers are cancers that arise from the skin. They are due to the development of abnormal cells that have the ability to invade or spread to other parts of the body.

Skin Cancer: Malignant vs Benign
This dataset contains a balanced dataset of images of benign skin moles and malignant skin moles.

Content
The data consists of two folders with each 1800 pictures (224x244) of the two types of moles.

Acknowledgements
All the rights of the Data are bound to the ISIC-Archive rights (https://www.isic-archive.com/#!/topWithHeader/wideContentTop/main). I do not take any responsibility for the right-infringement of any kernels. Thus, do not monetize this any of your models done on this data :).

Inspiration
I hope that with this dataset, some machine learning model might achieve better and cheaper prediction than a dermatologist.
Have fun!
